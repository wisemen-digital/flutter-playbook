# Meet the team

Meet our Flutter developers, they try!

<VPTeamMembers size="small" :members="members" />

# Roles

Everyone carries the responsibility of using the team's latest and greatest methods within the projects they're working on.
Of course we always have to keep innovating and finding better and more efficient ways to code. We divide it in these subjects to further our expertise.

### Architecture

Ensure our code is maintainable, legible and scalable. From how we do dependency injection to folder structure and much more.

### Testing

Figure out more efficient ways to test our code and improve our quality. So our developers can make new changes with ease of mind.

### Design

Maintain and improve our components library and design system.

### Automation

Maintain and create our [bricks](https://brickhub.dev/), vscode extension (code snippets) and other ways to speed up our development process.

### Pessimism

A tendency to see the worst aspect of things or believe that the worst will happen.
